# **Basic Physics Engine Project**

This project is a simple physics engine built using **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**. The engine simulates basic physics concepts such as motion, collision, and forces, providing an interactive way to understand and visualize physical phenomena.

---

## **Features**
- **Object Motion Simulation**: Visualize the movement of objects under various forces.
- **Collision Detection**: Handle interactions between objects using basic collision detection algorithms.
- **Gravity Simulation**: Implement gravitational forces for realistic physics behavior.
- **Interactive Controls**: Allow users to manipulate the environment and objects in real-time.
- **SFML Rendering**: Utilize SFML for 2D graphics rendering and smooth animations.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- **SFML Library**: Install the SFML library (v2.5 or later).
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming and physics principles.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Venkatesh-Shukla/basic-physics-engine.git
   cd basic-physics-engine
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Follow the instructions on the [SFML website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) to install SFML for your operating system.

3. **Build the Project**:
   Using `CMake` (if applicable):
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
   Alternatively, you can use your preferred IDE to set up the project with SFML.

## **Usage**
1. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./basic_physics_engine
   ```
2. Use the following controls to interact with the simulation:
   - **Arrow Keys**: Move the selected object.
   - **Space**: Pause/Resume the simulation.
   - **Mouse**: Select and drag objects.
